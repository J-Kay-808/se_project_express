# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This backend project is all about building a solid server for the WTWR app. We're using MongoDB to set up a reliable database and have created a REST API to handle all the usual create, read, update, and delete operations. The server is built with Node.js and Express, giving it a strong foundation within a JavaScript framework.

Paying close attention to security and have thoroughly tested everything using Postman to make sure it's all working smoothly. Plus, the server is fully deployable and ready to support web applications, making it a secure and efficient backend for WTWR.
## Running the Project

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
